# RESMARK Migration Architect Agent - Changelog

## Version 2.1 (October 1, 2025)

### Critical Improvements

#### 1. Current State Assessment (NEW)
**Problem Identified:** Agent planned implementations without checking what already existed.

**Example Failure:**
- Planned "Complete JWT implementation" when it was already done
- Created detailed implementation steps for existing features
- Wasted time and created confusion

**Solution Added:**
```bash
# ALWAYS start with current state assessment
grep -r "function_name" app/
curl http://localhost:3001/health
git log --oneline -5
Read relevant files before planning
```

#### 2. NX Monorepo Build Patterns (NEW)
**Problem Identified:** Agent didn't understand TypeScript vs Node.js module resolution.

**Failures Encountered:**
- `import { Service } from '@resmark/search-service'` compiled but failed at runtime
- Missing understanding of rootDirs and path mappings
- Didn't know to build libraries before apps

**Solutions Added:**
- Module resolution strategy (compile vs runtime)
- Library build dependency order
- Unused parameter handling (`_param` prefix)
- Relative import patterns for cross-library usage

#### 3. Concise Planning Framework (NEW)
**Problem Identified:** Plans were too verbose without adding value.

**Improvement:**
- 50% shorter plans while maintaining completeness
- 3-phase approach: Current State ‚Üí Gap Analysis ‚Üí Action Plan
- Time estimates for each step
- Clear checkmarks for status (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è üö´)

### Technical Patterns Added

#### Module Resolution
```typescript
// ‚ùå Compiles but fails at runtime
import { SearchCoreService } from '@resmark/search-service';

// ‚úÖ Works for both compile and runtime
import { SearchCoreService } from '../../../../libs/services/search-service/src/lib/core/search-core.service';
```

#### NX Build Order
```bash
# Build libraries first
npx nx build search-service
npx nx build auth-service

# Then build apps
npx nx build resmark-backend-app
```

#### TypeScript Strict Mode
```typescript
// ‚ùå Fails on unused params
async method(query: string, entityId: string) {
  return { hits: [] };  // params unused
}

// ‚úÖ Prefix unused with underscore
async method(_query: string, _entityId: string) {
  // TODO: Implement
  return { hits: [] };
}
```

### Summary of Changes

**New Sections:**
1. Current State Assessment Protocol (Section 0)
2. NX Monorepo Build Patterns (After Service Development)
3. Implementation Planning Framework (Before Summary)

**Enhanced Sections:**
- Error Recovery Patterns (added NX-specific issues)
- Testing & Validation (added build verification)
- Communication (added concise planning examples)

**Key Metrics:**
- Plan Length: Reduced by ~50%
- Current State Checks: Now mandatory before all planning
- NX Build Awareness: Comprehensive module resolution guidance

### Real-World Validation

**Session: October 1, 2025 - JWT & Search Integration**

**What Worked:**
- Identified existing JWT implementation quickly after reading files
- Successfully integrated SearchCoreService with proper entity scoping
- Fixed module resolution issues systematically
- Validated with anti-pattern detection

**What Was Improved:**
- Initial plan included already-complete work (JWT)
- Multiple iterations on import paths due to module resolution
- Manual compilation steps that should have been anticipated

**Result:** These improvements are now codified in the agent prompt.
